            <h2>Do You Feel Like a Commodity?</h2>
            <p class="date">— January 29, 2019 —</p>
            <p class="callout">
                Do you feel like a machine or a commodity?
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                If so, you are not the only one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>According to “The 5 Languages of Appreciation in the Workplace” by Gary Chapman, if no one </span>
                <span>notices a person’s commitment to doing the job well, that person’s motivation tends to wane </span>
                <span>over time.</span>  
            </p>
            <p> 
                <span>“Next to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival, to </span>
                <span>be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated,” notes Steven Covey, author </span>
                <span>of “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>So why “Just Say Thanks” doesn’t work? It’s what we are told to repeatedly tell our teams </span>
                <span>“great job!” and “thanks” especially to millennial workforce population? What researches </span>
                <span>found is that “just say thanks” can actually backfire, sparking cynicism among the ranks. </span>
                <span>While we all want to know we are valued, we want it to be authentic, not contrived. Additionally, </span>
                <span>catching team member doing what you want and saying “thanks” is showing them recognition. </span>
                <span>This is different from appreciation, which focuses on performance plus team member’s value </span>
                <span>as a person.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>So which appreciation language is yours and can you recognize which appreciation language will </span>
                <span>hit the mark with your team members? Gary Chapman in his book identifies five appreciation </span>
                <span>languages including words of affirmation, quality time, tangible gifts, acts of service, </span>
                <span>and physical touch. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>We typically gravitate towards what we value as a sign of appreciation. If you see a team </span>
                <span>member likes giving presents at work, then that is what they expect in return. Patting that </span>
                <span>person in the back (physical touch) and saying “I admire how organized your papers are!” </span>
                <span>(words of affirmation) may completely miss the mark. But giving them a tangible gift (price </span>
                <span>doesn’t matter!), will make them feel valued and appreciated as person rewarding the </span>
                <span>organization with a greater employee engagement.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>So if you do feel like a commodity, it’s in your hands to tell your leader what is the right </span>
                <span>way of motivation is for you:</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>“Leader, I really appreciate you sending me a note of “Thanks.” But what I really would prefer </span>
                <span>if you showed me your appreciation by giving me some tangible item that will remind me that you </span>
                <span>know how good of a job I’m doing when I look at it.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>And leaders, I encourage you to look around and see whose face becomes sour instead of happy when </span>
                <span>you give the words of affirmations that supposed to make it all good, but unfortunately will miss </span>
                <span>the mark with 50% of your team.</span>
            </p>
